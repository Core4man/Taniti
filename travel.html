				<h3><a href="https://www.priceline.com/">Option One: Airplane</a></h3>
				<p>The most popular way to arrive on the island is to take a propeller plane or small jet as of now. Taniti is working on expanding their airport within the next few years. This is by far the fastest way to the island.</p>

				<h3><a href="https://www.cruises.com/">Option Two: Boat</a></h3>
				<p>Although not as popular, you can arrive by a small cruise ship to the island one night per week. That would mean you must stay for a week before the boat returns.</p>

				<h3><a href="https://www.hertz.com/rentacar/reservation/">Option 1:Rental car/bike</a></h3>
				<p>Renting a car or bike is the most common way to travel around the island. It allows for better flexibility with your trip and can do more direct routes to a destination. If renting bikes, you must wear a helmet according to Taniti law.</p>

			<div id="bus">
				<h3><a href="https://www.greyhound.com/">Option 2:Buses or taxis</a></h3>
				<p>Buses are a economical way to get around the island. Public buses run from 5 am until 11pm every day around Taniti City. Private buses covers the rest of the island. Taxis can also be used to have a more direct path to your destination but cost more.</p>

			<div id="walking">
				<h3><a href="https://www.macsadventure.com/us">Option 3:Walking</a></h3>
				<p>Taniti City is very flat and can be explored via walking. This option is, of course, free, but has the drawback of not being able to leave Taniti City. This option is perfect if you want to stay in Taniti City the entire trip.</p>
